                <li>Stephen William Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking</li>
                <br>
                <li>He was a English theoretical physicist whose theory of exploding black holes drew upon both relativity theory and quantum mechanics. He also worked with space-time singularities.</li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Hawking studied physics at University College, Oxford (B.A., 1962), and Trinity Hall, Cambridge (Ph.D., 1966). He was elected a research fellow at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge.

                <li>Best known for: His work on explaining the origins of the universe and black holes</li>
                <br>
                <li>When Stephen was 17, he went to Oxford University to study physics and chemistry. He later said that he found his first year very boring! After graduating from Oxford, he went to Cambridge University to further his studies in cosmology (the science of the origin of the universe).
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>In 1985, Stephen developed a life-threatening infection. He had an emergency operation that saved his life but left him unable to talk. He was given a special computer that talked for him, which he controlled by moving a muscle in his cheek â€“ clever!</li>
                <br>
                <li> Stephen is remembered as an inspiration to many people. He had an amazing mind, incredible determination and didnâ€™t let his illness stand in his way. He defied doctorsâ€™ predictions, living for a further 55 years after his diagnosis.</li>
